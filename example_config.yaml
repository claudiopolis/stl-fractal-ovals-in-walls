# Example configuration file for 3D Wall-Holer
#
# This file demonstrates all available configuration parameters.
# You can use this with: python -m wallholer input.stl --config example_config.yaml

# Wall Detection Parameters
# These control how the program identifies thin flat walls in your model
wall_thickness_threshold: 6.0  # Maximum thickness (mm) for a wall to be considered "thin"
min_wall_dimension: 20.0       # Minimum width and length (mm) for a wall to be detected

# Oval Hole Parameters
# These control the size and pattern of the holes
max_oval_length_z: 70.0        # Maximum length of oval along z-axis (mm) - Level 0 optimized to fit wall
oval_aspect_ratio: 3.0         # Ratio of length to width (e.g., 3.0 = 3:1, or 2.5 = 2.5:1)
min_wall_width: 4.0            # Minimum wall material width between holes and edges (mm)
num_oval_sizes: 2              # Number of different oval sizes for fractal pattern (2-4 recommended)

# Wall Selection
# Specify which walls to modify (based on wall IDs from visualization)
# Run in interactive mode first to see wall IDs, then add them here
selected_walls: [0, 1, 2]      # List of wall IDs to modify

# Bottom Wall
# Specify which wall represents the build plate (z=0) of your 3D printer
# This determines the z-axis direction for oval orientation
bottom_wall: 0                 # Wall ID that is attached to the build plate
